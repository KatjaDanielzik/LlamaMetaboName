# LlamaMetaboName: a system prompt for Llama3.3 to facilitate standardization of metabolite names

# Overview
One of the crucial steps in the Metabolomics workflow is the matching of metabolite names provided by a collaborator to database entry, to for example retrieve IDs for downstream analysis.
Although most database APIs accept multiple synonyms, some metabolite names remain unmatched although a human would find the respective entry in the database. Additionally multiple file conversions during the life cycle of a dataset might introduce special characters like "?" that impede recognition by databases.

Large Language models like Llama3.3 have learned which metabolite names are often used in published literature (i.e. metabolite names without special characters) and could assist in the standardization of metabolite names that would otherwise consume a lot of time by hand.

# Install ollama
```{bash}
# install ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

# build model from modelfile
ollama create MetaboNameStandard --file ~/<path>/MetaboNameStandard.modelfile

# check that model was created
ollama list
```

# Example workflow in R with rollama (ollama API) and RefMet
```{r}
# install and load needed packages
if(!require("rollama")) install_github("JBGruber/rollama")
if (!require("RefMet")) install_github("metabolomicsworkbench/RefMet")
if (!require("dplyr")) install.packages("dplyr")
library(RefMet)
library(rollama)
library(dplyr)

# load data (stored as dataframe with "metabolite" specifying metabolite names)
data <- read.csv("path to folder")

# hand raw metabolite names to RefMet
refmet_output <- RefMet::refmet_map_df(data$metabolite)

# filter for missing metabolite names
non_standardized <- refmet_output%>%filter(Standardized.name=="-")

# using MetaboNameStandard
## Selecting model
rollama::options(rollama_model = "MetaboNameStandard")

# Build prompt query
queries <- rollama::make_query(
              text = non_standardized$Input.name # unrecognized metabolite names
              prompt = "Only output the standardized metabolite name without any explanation.")

# run query and store query results as new column
non_standardized$LLM_standardized <- rollama::query(queries,
                                                      screen = FALSE, 
                                                      output = "text"
                                                        )

# Print results
non_standardized
```

# Example usage 
We applied MetaboliteNameStandardization to a set of ??? metabolite names from untargeted LC-MS, which did not contain any lipids and found that the model sufficiently converted ????/??? in a name that could be recognized by the R RefMet API.
Although the temperature and ??? are set to low number, reducing hallucinations of the model, we would suggest to follow this workflow: first feed all your metabolite names into a database, filter for unrecognized ones and only use MetaboliteNameStandardization for the remaining ones.

# Limitations
- Problems that we are aware of:
- Nucleotide: sometimes alterations of deoxy Nucleotides (e.g. dATP) to Nucleotides (ATP) or vice versa. As we found that many databases are not consistent either in their IDs regarding these metabolites this behavior might be caused by the database entries.
