Description: MetaboDynamics is an R-package that provides a framework of 
  probabilistic models to analyze longitudinal metabolomics data. It enables 
  robust estimation of mean concentrations despite varying spread between 
  timepoints and reports differences between timepoints as well as metabolite 
  specific dynamics profiles that can be used for identifying "dynamics clusters" 
  of metabolites of similar dynamics. Provides probabilistic over-representation 
  analysis of KEGG functional modules and pathways as well as comparison between
  clusters of different experimental conditions.
